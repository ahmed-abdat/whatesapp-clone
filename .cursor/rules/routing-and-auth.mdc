description: routing map and auth guard behavior
---

## Routes

- Defined in [src/App.jsx](mdc:src/App.jsx) using React Router v6 with lazy imports and Suspense fallback.
- Map:
  - `/` → `Home` (guarded by `RequireAuth`)
  - `/welcoome` → `Welcoome`
  - `/signUp` → `SignUp`
  - `/otp` → `Otp`
  - `/userInfo` → `UserInfo`
  - `*` → `NotFound`

## Auth guard `RequireAuth`

- Access allowed if any of the following is true:
  - Logged in user AND phone verified (`getIsPhoneUserVerified()`)
  - Logged in user AND email user (`getIsEmailUser()`)
  - Logged in user AND anonymous user (`getIsAnonymousUser()`)
- Otherwise redirect to `/welcoome`.

## Auth sources

- Phone with OTP via Firebase Auth + Recaptcha.
- Google OAuth via popup.
- Anonymous sign-in.
- After auth, user profile is completed at `/userInfo` and stored in Firestore.
